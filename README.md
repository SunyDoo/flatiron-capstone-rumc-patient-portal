## RUMC Patient Portal

### Overview

RUMC Patient Portal is a web application that allows users to set up appointments with physicians from Richmond University Medical Center.

### Features

The landing page for the site will show users the home screen with a carousel of images relating to the hospital.
From here, the user has several pages they can visit without needing to log in.

The "Our Team" tab on the navigation bar will display a list of all the departments within the hospital network. Selecting a department will display all the physicians who specialize in that department.

Selecting "Locations" will display an interactive map of Staten Island, with map markers to pinpoint the locations affiliated with the hospital. To the right of the mnap will also be a list of all the locations listed in card format. Selecting a card will display further information about the location.

The "Testimonials" tab will show all the positive reviews for various locations given by patients.

The footer of the web app also contains some quick links for the user. These links include contact information, patients bill of rights and an "about us" page for the hospital.

The user can log in from the button at the top right of the page. If they do not already have an account with the hospital, they can sign up with their full name, username, and insurance provider. Once logged in, the user will now have access to 3 more routes:

"View Appointments" will take users to a list of all of their upcoming appointments. These appointment cards will display all of the necessary information for the user regarding their appointment, including the physician, time and location of the appointment. They will also have the option to change their appointment time, or cancel an appointment if they wish.

"Make Appointment" will take users to a list of all available physicians in the hospital network. A user can filter the physicians displayed on the screen by either the department, or the insurance network covered by the physician, or the user can use both filters to narrow down who they would like to make an appointment with. Once a physician is selected, the user can select a date and time for the appointment, as long as that physician does not already have an appointment booked for the selected date and time.

"Leave Feedback" will take users to a form to leave a brief review of their experience at a particular location during their visit. If they had a positive experience and they select the option to recommend the location, then their testimonial will be saved to the database and displayed to the "Testimonials" page of the web app.
